// The lifecycle of the NSE looks something like the following:
//  1)  App receives notification
//  2)  System creates an instance of the extension class
//      and calls `didReceive` in the background
//  3)  Extension processes messages / displays whatever
//      notifications it needs to
//  4)  Extension notifies its work is complete by calling
//      the contentHandler
//  5)  If the extension takes too long to perform its work
//      (more than 30s), it will be notified and immediately
//      terminated
//
// Note that the NSE does *not* always spawn a new process to
// handle a new notification and will also try and process notifications
// in parallel. `didReceive` could be called twice for the same process,
// but it will always be called on different threads. It may or may not be
// called on the same instance of `NotificationService` as a previous
// notification.
//
// We keep a global `environment` singleton to ensure that our app context,
// database, logging, etc. are only ever setup once per *process*
